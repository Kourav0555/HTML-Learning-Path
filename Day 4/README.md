# Day 4 - HTML Learning Progress

Today I have explored more HTML tags and elements, so here’s what I have learned:

#  Topics Covered

- **Inline vs Block Elements** – Understanding the difference between elements that take full width (block) and those that stay inline.
- **`<span>` Element** – Used for styling or grouping inline text without breaking the flow.
- **`<div>` Element** – A block-level container for structuring content on a webpage.
- **`<hr>` Tag** – Creates a horizontal line to visually separate content.
- **`<sub>` Element** – Displays text as subscript (e.g., H<sub>2</sub>O).
- **`<sup>` Element** – Displays text as superscript (e.g., X<sup>2</sup>).

# Inshort
 * Inline elements do not start on a new line.
 * Block elements always take up the full width.
 * <span> is great for styling parts of text.
 * <div> helps structure layouts.
 * <hr>, <sub>, and <sup> are useful for formatting and scientific notations.
