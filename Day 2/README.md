# Day 2 - HTML Boilerplate

## What I Learned
- The **basic structure** of an HTML page.
- Purpose of important tags:
  - `<!DOCTYPE html>` → Tells the browser this is an HTML5 document.
  - `<html>` → Root element of the page.
  - `<head>` → Contains metadata like title, charset, and viewport settings.
  - `<title>` → Text shown in the browser tab.
  - `<body>` → All visible content goes here.

##  Practice File
- `boilerplate.html` → Contains a simple HTML boilerplate with a heading and paragraph.

##  Output
When opened in the browser, it shows:
- A title in the tab.
- A main heading → "First Boilerplate"
- A paragraph → " Hello Developers!This is the basic structure of an HTML page."



With this, I now understand the foundation of every HTML file. All future web pages will start from this structure.
